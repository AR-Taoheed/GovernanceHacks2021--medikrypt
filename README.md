# GovernanceHacks2021--MediKrypt

MediKrypt is a proposed Blockchain-based **Universal Identity and Healthcare Documentation Platform**. 

MediKrypt aim to become the #1 decentralized digital identity information and healthcare repository for use in hospitals globally. This is to allow for easy access to healthcare and patient record globally by hospitals through a secured platform (MediKrypt).

Given the sensitivity of patient records, the platform put into consideration securing the record using the Stardard Health Record Format (SHR).

The health record is stored using the Standard Health Record (SHR) format developed by the open-source Standard Health Record Collaborative (SHRC). At the time of identity registration and onboarding at a hospital or designated center, a citizen provides their medical history in their local language and their respective acceptable Identity Number.

During the testing and pilot phase of this project we will be focusing on Nigeria as our case study and using it's National Identity Number (NIN) as our primary Identity number.
